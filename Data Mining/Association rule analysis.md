### *First Association Rule Discussion*
Rule: If a customer buys bread, they are likely to also buy milk.

Support: 0.35 → This means 35% of all transactions in the dataset contain both bread and milk. That’s a relatively high proportion, showing the combination is common.

Confidence: 73.68% → When bread is purchased, there’s about a 74% chance milk is also in the basket.

Lift: 1.64 → This means that customers who buy bread are 1.64 times more likely to also buy milk than customers chosen at random. A lift greater than 1 indicates a positive association.

Implication for retail decisions:
This rule suggests that bread and milk have a strong buying relationship, so retailers could:

Product placement: Put bread and milk near each other in the store to encourage impulse buying.

Bundling & promotions: Offer discounts when customers buy both together.

Stocking strategy: Ensure both products are always available, especially during peak hours, since running out of one could hurt sales of the other.
